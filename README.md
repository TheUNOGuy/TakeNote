A free text editor for windows with a varitey of options more than Notepad made using Python. Different branches for different versions and anyone can contribute!

# Using the application

The only and most obvious way is to execute the installer file! It will install all the necessary files and the application will be ready to use!...Also the installer will be updated in a future update! A shortcut will be created on Desktop and the app will be added to the Windows app list! Also you can make this app your default editor for TXT files! More features soon in future updates!

# Contributing

There are different branches created for contributing to different versions. Note that you are not expected to give major updates; You can correct any bug fixes or just add a new option or two. Every folder has a Readme.txt to help you give you a more in - depth understanding of each file. In the 'Program & Files' folder you will find all the .py files for contributing!

In the 'TakeNotes' file you will find a link which will contain a link to a folder where you will find all the files which make the TakeNotes application run ( Uploaded in drive becuase folder was too big for GitHub ). These files will automatically be installed when the installer is executed. It isn't really advised to touch those files; They are just there for the client to know what they are installing. If you know what you are doing, you can obviously change them :)

This Installer and the application itself is converted to an exe using 'Pyinstaller' and the code was modified to fit that. All the files uploaded in drive are made by Pyinstaller.
