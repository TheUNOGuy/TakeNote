What is encryption?

Answer: Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process 
of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext. In simpler terms, encryption takes readable data and 
alters it so that it appears random. - Credits: Cloudfare

Well we do the same thing, read below...
------------------------------------------

Note ( Important! ): 1. You need to remember your pin to decrypt your file! You can either note it down in a book or keep a file on another computer
with the pin...Anyway it's upto you about how you need to remember it.

2. Do not tamper with your encrypted file. If you want to edit it, decrypt the file, edit it and encrypt it again and remember the new pin!

3. The 'Forgot Pin' menu option should only be used if you forgot your pin and you really want to decrypt your file! If it's not that important please don't
use it.
------------------------------------------

How to encrypt a file?

Answer: Open the file you want to encrypt. Then go under the Encryption menu and select 'Encrypt file'. Your file will be encrypted and a pin will be
displayed which you need to remember! Without the pin you cannot decrypt your file!

How do I decrypt a file?

Answer: Open the encrypted file. Then under the Encryption menu select 'Decrypt file'. Enter the decryption pin of the file. Your file will be decrypted!
------------------------------------------
Note: The pin handed to you will be invalid after decrypting. If you want to encrypt your file again, repeat the process.
------------------------------------------

Is TakeNotes's encryption safe?

Answer: From an outsiders point of view it's impossible they can hack your file and decrypt it without the pin! This is because we developed a special
private module called 'encrypt' which no one can have any idea about. Only a person, who has access to your computer and knows python, can study
the code for hours and gets to know how the encryption works can maybe get your pin. But that's in very rare circumstances...Also, the encrypt module 
code is made in such a way that it's a but tough to understand the code. So yes, your encrypted file is safe and can be decrypted by you or with anyone
you share the pin with!
